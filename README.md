# JFLA-conf-template

Typst template for the JFLA (journées français des languages applicatifs) conference.

This package has not (yet) been published to Typst Universe. So to use it you have to copy paste the `jfla.typ` file.

# Minimal Example

Here is a minimal example assuming the `jfla.typ' file is in the same directory
as the example : 

```
#import "jfla.typ": *
#show: jfla-conf-template.with(

# How to build Typst document

The general way to compile a file in Typst is to run this command :
```
typst compile main.typ main.pdf
```

(`main.pdf` is not necessary here because the file is named `main.typ`)

Typst cannot use files outside of the working directory which is by default the
directory of the file you are compiling. To change this default run this :
```
typst c main.typ main.pdf --root other/root/directory/
```

(you can write `c` for `compile`)

<!-- Fonts cannot be embedded inside of Typst packages. Typst by default look at -->
<!-- system fonts. We are using specific 2 fonts : -->
<!-- - "New Computer Modern" which is embedded inside the typst binary so this should not pose any probrem -->
